# FE21-JS2-slutprojekt-SNL :boom:

This is a final project for the Javascript 2 course at Grit Academy Malm√∂, Sweden. We are making a social media app!

Our app is all about sharing the interest for food, beer and wine! You can discuss with friends and visit other profiles, and no negativity is allowed.
Let's spread our love for the things we like. 

Just create an account and start discussing the greatest places on earth to get :beer: :wine_glass: :fork_and_knife:

### How this project was made:

We all planned it before coding started. That included drawing a layout, creating Firebase Database, starting up the npm to make Parcel work etc. 

### Main tasks

<em>@nathaliedpettersson</em> - Responsible for login and sign up</br>
<em>@SaraM83</em> - Responsible for displaying profiles of logged in user and all other users</br>
<em>@Takikato09</em> - Responsible for forum page with the three topics</br>

Aside from this we all contributed to the project by helping each other, that's what made us a good team.
